Pulling changes from local master to local branch::
===================================================
Once you have updated your local master with remote master then ou can propagate that chnage to other branch::

git checkout <branch>
git rebase master

Now for rolling back changes or making the local branch drop those changes that came from master::

$ git reflog

b710729 HEAD@{0}: rebase: some commit
5ad7c1c HEAD@{1}: rebase: another commit
deafcbf HEAD@{2}: checkout: moving from master to my-branch //this thing is important
...

$ git reset HEAD@{2} --hard
Now you should be back to before the rebase started.

By mistake if you post node_modules in your github repos then doing this command will remove from repos.
