1. install heroku in terminal if not there. test heroku by typing "heroku"
2. login on heroku
      heroku login
3. create a shell of applications on heroku
      heroku create
      
4. Then go to gem file:
    Since locally we are using sqlite database but in production we cannot use it so need to make some changes in "Gemfile"
    
    cut below statement from global file:
        # Use sqlite3 as the database for Active Record
        gem 'sqlite3', '~> 1.4'
        
    and paste it inside "group :development, :test" as below::
    
    group :development, :test do
      gem 'sqlite3', '~> 1.4' // added sqlite for development and testing
    end
    
  5. Add group production and add gem pg(postgres) in Gemfile as below::
        // in the end of file
        group :production do
           gem "pg"
        end
        
        This will ready for production deploy.
        
  6. Fire below commands in terminal since we made changes in Gemfile.
      
      bundle install --without production
      
 7. Fire below commands for final deploy::
  
    git add .
    git commit -m "readying for deploy"
    // pushing code on heroku master
    git push heroku master
    
    So now an address appears for opening on server but we can fire "heroku open" also for directly opening on other tab.
    
    The name of url will not be very nice so need to we can change it depending on availability by typing::
     "heroku rename blog-alphy"
     
     depending on availability "blog-alphy.herokuapp.com" will be our url.
