For better SEO purpose we need to do 2 things::

1. First in the head htmnl tag of each page we need to implement meta tags for better SEO with helmet package.

2. We need to generate a sitemap.xml inside the project with some packages like::

    "gatsby-plugin-sitemap": "3.3.0" 
    
    example in gatsbyjs and it generates only in staging/production server, not on localhost so that google bots can read these links and display in google 
    search.
    And we need to submit this sitemap URL, ex:: https://bolttech.io/sitemap.xml to google console so that google bots can read it.
