git log --graph --all  --decorate --oneline 
// this is important to check commits on recent branch


Both cmds can be used together or only reset commands
=====================================================
git reset --hard // remove any changes made
git clean -df. // to delete any files made by you



Check master at a particular time may be 1 week back from current date or 20 days back in a DETACHED HEAD
=========================================================================================================
we can see all the files on that date and using file comparision tool find the changes.

//create a detached head and checkout to 3rd may 2020 at 6.30pm in the evening.

git checkout 'master@{2020-05-03 18:30:00}'



GIT AMEND
==========
suppose i pushed some commits and even made a MR which is not merged yet to the master and i discovered that some console 
statements or comments are there whic h needs to be removed from the existing commits(instead of making new commit)
so the way is::

remove the comments or console from files and::

git add . && git commit --amend
git push

In normal scenario it will work but there might be times when it will not work then we need to fire below commands::

ls -a
cd .git

if you fine a file like this "COMMIT_EDITMSG.swp" then go to "finder" and press command + shift + .(dot)
and it will show hidden files and we can manually delete this.
