git log --graph --all  --decorate --oneline 
// this is important to check commits on recent branch


Both cmds can be used together or only reset commands
=====================================================
git reset --hard // remove any changes made
git clean -df. // to delete any files made by you



Check master at a particular time may be 1 week back from current date or 20 days back in a DETACHED HEAD
=========================================================================================================
we can see all the files on that date and using file comparision tool find the changes.

//create a detached head and checkout to 3rd may 2020 at 6.30pm in the evening.

git checkout 'master@{2020-05-03 18:30:00}'



GIT AMEND
==========
suppose i pushed some commits and even made a MR which is not merged yet to the master and i discovered that some console 
statements or comments are there whic h needs to be removed from the existing commits(instead of making new commit)
so the way is::

remove the comments or console from files and::

git add . && git commit --amend
git push

In normal scenario it will work but there might be times when it will not work then we need to fire below commands::

ls -a
cd .git


if you fine a file like this "COMMIT_EDITMSG.swp" then go to "finder" and press command + shift + .(dot)
and it will show hidden files and we can manually delete this.

===========
UPDATE A OUTDATED BRANCH WITH MASTER


When we start working on a branch that is outdated because of continous merge on remote origin then if we complete our work on local
branch and push it then there may be conflicts and pipeline may fail.
For that we need to pull the lastest origin/master in our local branch and then push it for it to be merged.

for example:
when we are on below branch
4806/enhancement-of-addcreditmodal-input-box

we need to fire :
git pull origin master


or second way or long way::

go back to local master as:
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout 4806/enhancement-of-addcreditmodal-input-box
git rebase master

=============================

PIPELINE INFORMATION:
There is a pipeline associated with each github/gitlab so we need to run pipeline or check that when a "git push" of a local branch 
then a pipeline runs which make it GREEN or eligible to MERGE.
