2. For renaming board, just click on top left side, possible name like "working stuff" and then you can rename it.
3. For creating new mindmap, on top left, we have hamburger menu. CLicking on that, we can select board and then create new board, which is kind of blank canvas.
4. Next , we can create new mindmap or something in that.
5. Once created, we can share it with other people by email or their miro profiles also and can give them accesses too.
