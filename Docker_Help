-> checking running currently active docker containers:
sudo docker ps

-> Checking all the container ever run and its ID too:
sudo docker ps --all
 
-> Run a stopped container::
sudo docker start -a ae59735bbd2e    // container id  is ae59735bbd2e.

-> Remove all the stopped containers from system::
sudo docker system prune
   After this if you fire "sudo docker ps --all", you get 0 containers shown.



DEBUGGING A CONTAINER FOR LOGS::
===============================
sudo docker logs ad638ff0b0b3f8ca46ee1dad58c1d6f7f2396e217b2f5d1ec35a6a260c929   // containerID



STOP A DOCKER CONTAINER::
========================

sudo docker stop <container id>  // get container id with "sudo docker ps" or "sudo docker ps --all"

sudo docker kill <container id>


EXECUTING COMMANDS IN A RUNNING CONTAINERS::
===========================================
in one terminal you fetch and run docker image like ::
   docker run redis.
   
In other terminal 
 get the container_id:
   -> sudo docker ps 
 Now run command isnide the container created from image installed in terminal 1.
 --> sudo docker exec -it 447a63ec2569 redis-cli  // container id is given and "redis-cli" is the command for entering inside redis CLI to manipulate redis.


TIP::
=====

Changing the docker file can be very expensive and if we change the sequence of CMDs then it will start from fresh installation and can
take more time.
If any new cmd added then it should be added in the end not in the middle or top bcoz docker re runs everything from changed line and
it cannot use the cache memory also.
