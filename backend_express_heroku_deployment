## Bugs when dynamic route is above static route:
----------------------------------------------- 

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});

//dynamic route
app.get("/api/v1/:token", (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).json({param: req.params.token});
});  

//static route
app.get("/api/v1/instagram", (req, res) => {
    const instaSocial = {
        username: "arjun2010", followers: 55,
    }
  res.status(200).json({instaSocial});
});

//static route
app.get("/api/v1/facebook", (req, res) => {
    const instaSocial = {
        username: "arjun2010fb", followers: 65,
    }
  res.status(200).json({instaSocial});
});


1. Since dynamic route even though in middle but is present above many static routes so it causes an issue of always returning value of dynamic route i.e

res.status(200).json({param: req.params.token});

even though you make a request for all below static routes:
"/api/v1/instagram" or
"/api/v1/facebook"

Because dynamic route has "/api/v1" common with static routes so it assumes that other string value can be dynamic and thus returnns the response of dynamic value.

2. To fix this issue, always keep your dynamic route at the end of similar static route to make it work.





## Push to Heroku:

1. git init
2. add and commit to git
3. optionally push to GITHUB

4. Create heroku app on server (Thus, the redirected UI will display next steps as step 5+)
5. "heroku login" on local machine 
6. Push code to heroku app (git push heroku main)
7. debug, then add, commit and next
8. push again (git push heroku main)

Note:
GIT master is different from heroku master.

ALways remember that your local GIT branch need to be "master" for typing below comd.
git push heroku master

else if it is "main" then type:
git push heroku main


## Find Deployment error:
-------------------------
1. Clicking on "Overview" tab and click on "Open app" and it will open a page where error displays


## Debug Heroku deployment error
-------------------------------

1. Clicking on "Settings" tab.
2. Go to "Config Vars" and select "Reveal config Vars" button, which is a place to verify   
    ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES is good or not.
3. Imagine you find some local code issue then you fix locally and then git add and commit.
    Next, type : git push heroku master (considering your local branch is master, else it wil be issue)

4. In index.js file, you find PORT variable as:
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000; 
    // the first part of this PORT is from environment variable, and this is very important during deployment as deployment server will allott their available PORT only not the one provided from us.

5.  In package.json, during development we had the start script as:
    "start": "nodemon index.js" , 

    But since nodemon is a dev dependency and it gets prunned or removed while doing deployment
    so this script needs to be updated for it to work as:

    "start": "node index.js"

    Update above and do git add, commit and finally :
    git push heroku master

    to do deployment

6. Now Everything will work fine.

Note:
1. We can push our backend code to github.
2. But deployment is happening from local machine to heroku, although GIT server can also do so but we are doing previous one.


## Custom domain and SSL settings
    In the settings tab, if you scroll down, then you can definately add custom domain and SSL certificates also there.
