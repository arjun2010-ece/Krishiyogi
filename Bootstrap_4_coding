1. Creating for medium screen small screen
===========================================

Note:
1. Mentioning "col-md-6 or col-md-4" means it is for medium and large and extra large screen only 
and for small screens it will take 12 columns grid by default but if we specify col-10/col-8 
then it will take that much and we can center that on small screens.

example1:
Since bootstrap has 12 grids, we are designing fonly for  medium and large screen specifically.
for small screens it will take 12 olumns

<section id="services">
 <div class="container">
   <div class="row">
     <div class="col-md-4"> //on >=medium screen it'll take 4 grids but on small screen it will take 12 column grids
       <h3>Title</h3>
       <p>Description....</p>
     </div>
     <div class="col-md-4"> //on >=medium screen it'll take 4 grids
       <h3>Title</h3>
       <p>Description....</p>
     </div>
     <div class="col-md-4"> //on >=medium screen it'll take 4 grids
       <h3>Title</h3>
       <p>Description....</p>
     </div>
   </div>
 </div>
</section>


example2:
for the above example if we want to design "for small screens specifically too" along with >=medium screens.
We will add "col-10". If we add "col-10" for small screens then we need to center that DIV blcok with "mx-auto" 
only on small screen .
we can additionally put "text-center" to center the contents too on both small and medium screens.

<section id="services">
 <div class="container">
   <div class="row">
     <div class="col-10  col-md-4 mx-auto text-center"> //on >=medium screen it'll take 4 grids but on small screen it will take 12 column grids
       <h3>Title</h3>
       <p>Description....</p>
     </div>
     <div class="col-10  col-md-4 mx-auto text-center"> //on >=medium screen it'll take 4 grids
       <h3>Title</h3>
       <p>Description....</p>
     </div>
     <div class="col-10 col-md-4 mx-auto text-center"> //on >=medium screen it'll take 4 grids
       <h3>Title</h3>
       <p>Description....</p>
     </div>
   </div>
 </div>
</section>
