1. whenever in same project if you want to reset by deleting all the files, still you need to drop the tables from the database
   and the below command wipe out the database completely::
   
   rake db:drop:all   --> for dropping all test, development and production databases
   bundle exec rake db:drop RAILS_ENV=test   ---> for dropping only test database
