While testing react apps, we might need to see the whole rendered html on the browser or terminal.

And since terminal does not print the whole html so it becomes difficult for debugging, even though if you use "debug()" in the react test.

So the best way is to write the whole log in a file like this:


import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';


it('your test case', () => {
  const { container } = render(<YourComponent />);
  fs.writeFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'debug-output.html'), container.innerHTML);
});


debug-output.html will get created with all the html code that might not be printed wholly on terminal so do not do "debug()" but instead do above.
This is best practice.
