The very basic animation lists on the texts::

I need to copy these animations in codepen for future use.


CSS ANIMATIONS MAJOR PROPERTIES::
=================================

1. transform: translate (x, y, z directions) : moving in either x axis (straight ), or y-axis or z-axis.
2. transform: rotating (x, y, z directions) : rotating in either x axis (straight ), or y-axis or z-axis.
3. transform: scale - increasing size in  (x, y, z directions) : increasing in either x axis (straight ), or y-axis or z-axis.


DOING ANIMATIONS only on one element is very easy BUT if you want to simultaneously do animations on multiple elements together
then you need to sync when they start or decide their sequence, like first one start immediately , second one after 5 second and third one after 10 seconds.
AND that is decided by ANIMATION DELAY PROPERTY and that is used together with ANIMATION DURATION PROPERTY.


example:
 display multiple images one after other like, 3 sets of images with each set having some images and display each set one after other in fadeIN/fadeOut way.
 
 3 imgbox tells 3 different sets of images that need to display one after other.

CSS:::
=======

.imgbox{
  display: flex; 
  align-items: center;
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  background-position: center center;
  background-size: cover; 
}
.imgbox img{
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  margin: 32px;
}
#img1{
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 3;
  animation: xfade 15s -0s infinite;
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
}

#img2{
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 2;
  animation: xfade 15s -5s infinite;
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
}

#img3{
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 1;
  animation: xfade 15s -10s infinite;
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
}

@keyframes xfade{
    0% {opacity: 0;}
    20% {opacity: 1;}
    33% {opacity: 1;}
    53% {opacity: 0;}
    100% {opacity: 0;}
}

here xfade animations has multiple stages for smooth fadeing effect, infact the more stages the more smooth effect happens.

If you observe #img1, #img2 and #img3 then you find that all the 3 different sets of images are implementing animation.

BUT the big BUT lies in when each animation starts and that is decided by animation delay property.

#img1{
  animation: xfade 15s -0s infinite; // here -0s/0s tells start the animation ( and visible too immediately) immediately that will last for 15s.
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;  // bcoz of (-0s) animation delay it will start and visible immediately.
}

#img2{
  animation: xfade 15s -5s infinite; // animation will start much before (but will remain invisible) the starting time but will be visible only 
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out; // after 5s of animation time/duration has passed bcoz of (-5s) animation delay.
}

#img3{
  animation: xfade 15s -10s infinite; // animation will start much before (but will remain invisible) the starting time but will be visible only 
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out; // after 10s of animation time/duration has passed bcoz of (-10s) animation delay.
}
