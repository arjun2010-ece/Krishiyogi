Memory formula:
================

Location = Word
Image = Pronunciation
Action = Meaning


Memory palaces:
==============
These are the palaces where you have stored informations.
They are mental constructs based on real places that you are familiar with.
A memory palace is essentially a "journey" through a location you are intimately familiar with.


The less you have to memorize about memory palaces, the more you can focus on vocabularies and move from word to word naturally as part of your journey.

Process:
- Think of the place like your home and mentally walk through it.

Tips:
- Start with the place you currently live, and make it your memory palace.
- Then another placees could be your gym, your office, shopping mall etc.
- For organising all the memories start from memory library and then each book of the library can be its own memory palace. 
Or an apartment with compartments.


Construct a memory palace:
==========================

- Your location will be a memory palace.
- Stations are the "stops" within a memory palace/location where you will place your words.

one station = An entire room (more complex options are available later).

- Draw the layout of the place that you live.

- Try to locate atleast 10 rooms or stations in your place like :
  1. Office
  2. bedroom
  3. Hallway
  4. Closet etc

** Rooms - Here rooms does not necessarily mean room in a house but specifically a place.
For example: Closet or bedroom etc.

- There are in fact two types of stations:

* Macro-stations
* Micro-stations

A macro-station is an entire room (i.e. bedroom, kitchen, living room, or bathroom). 
A micro-station is an element inside of a room (i.e. a bookcase, bed, TV set).


- See each station "visually" in your mind.

- Create this list like a journey that you will make through out your memory palace.

- Have a linear journey, not a criscross journey, for e.g: bedroom to bathroom to bedroom again, that creates confusion.

- Begin in "terminal locations" or "from one end of the palace" to avoid trapping yourself in your own Memory Palace.

- Always leave yourself with room to add more stations in your Memory Palaces.

For e.g: Like when i go to the end of the door, i can go down the stairs, out to the building door, i could go to the parking lot, i could go to the bus stop, i could go to the corner of certain street that i know very well and so on. 

You can continue adding stations after stations as you will need them.

- Avoid reusing the same memory palace again and again for committing different memories.
But language learning is an exception like, can use same memory palace for verbs, then nouns also.

- Avoid virtual memory palaces, but can give it a try.

- Walk different places and try to find atleast 10 stations or more to be made memory palace later in future if needed.


How to find more palaces for storing multiple memories:
=======================================================

I sat down and determined all the places I have lived and all the schools I attended. 

- At that time, I listed eight cities, twenty-five houses (or apartments) and sixteen neighborhoods within those cities. 

- I then added the homes of my friends and family member. There are even hotel rooms that I remember very
well in cities that I have visited. 

- The path I took from an apartment in Paris to the Louvre, for instance,
has served me very well over the years. 

I’ve found that the number of Memory Palaces I can build is
exponential. 
The list expands each and every time I travel or intentionally step into a store I’ve never
visited before.

By intentionally, I mean deliberately deciding that each new building could become a Memory Palace and
paying attention to its layout.

Deliberately decide that each new building could become a memory palace.

If you start doing this, "you’ll have more than enough buildings from your
past and present to build all the Memory Palaces you could ever need" while adding new ones as part of
your future as a Magnetic Memorizer.

- Different cities or neighbourhood
- Your homes
- Homes of your friends
- Schools
- Hospitals
- Your doctors office
- Your dentists office
- Govt offices
- your workplace
- Swimming pool / recreational centres
- Movie theatres

* Pay attention to your surroundings: New memory places are always yet to come.



How to learn and memorize the vocabulary of any language that you want:
========================================================================

- We need as many Memory palaces as there are letters in the alphabet of our target language.
- Not all memory palaces have to be the same "size".
- Wherever possible, associate each memory palace with a letter of the alphabet.
- For letter "A", you can have "Accenture's office in portugal" or Anganwadi" as your memory palace with stations like:
	- Entrance Area
	- Play Area
	- Classroom
	- Nutrition Area
	- Health Check-up Room
	- Storage Room
	- Garden

	Place each word in each above stations and make it as visually vivid or funny or weird and then journey from "Entrance area" to "Garden".

- 	For letter "B", you can have "Bakery" as your memory palace with stations like:
	- Entrance Area
	- Display Counter
	- Bread Section
	- Cake Section
	- Oven Area
	- Ingredients Shelf 
	- Packaging Area 

	Place each word in each above stations and make it as visually vivid or funny or weird and then journey from "Entrance area" to "Packaging Area".

- You can also assign more than one Memory Palace to each letter of the alphabet. 
For example, you could have:

	A1
	A2
	A3
	B1
	B2
	B3
	B4

This strategy can be especially handy when using Memory Palaces to acquire the massive amounts of foreign language vocabulary you’ll need to approach fluency in a foreign language. 

The Magnetic Memory Method
is perfectly suited for that


Similarly, can be done for all 26 alphabets, if needed use chatgpt for that.
First, note down all the keys like "A - Accenture's office in portugal" or "A - Anganwadi", "B - Bakery", "C - Cafe" in the first page before individually drawing and writing all the stations of that specific memory palaces.

- Always draw and note down the memory palace in notebook so that you will always remember this.

You can use:
- Hotel rooms
- Museums
- Journeys between hotels & museums, pay attention to the walk between them.

Pay attention to your surroundings, there is a wealth of informations.

- if you are riding a subway, focus on different station that can become memory palace.



Step 1: create or find memory palaces.
Step 2: The principle of imagination and imagery.
		We use imagery to associate with the sounds and meanings of the words we want to memorize.
		Images should be large, vibrant and bright. Exaggeration is fundamental.
		We use images to recall the sound and meaning of memorized vocabulary.


Step 3: The principle of action.
Imagine your words move like snake. or jump like kangaroo.
Your minds eye catches the action more strongly and commit it to memory for longer period of time.


The ultimate Memorization equation:
-----------------------------------
Our memory palace is made up of various locations/stations.

so, 
Location = vocabulary word.
Image = (Correct) pronounciation
Action = Meaning of the vocabulary


Language of memory is images that hels you remember/recall.




================================

First, instead of using an entire room to memorize one word or one phrase, try this instead:

Create multiple stations in that room. You can do this readily by:

Having a station in each corner
Having a station on each wall
Having stations on the floor and the ceiling

- That would add up to at least 10 stations per room.

There’s a potential problem, however, because using the ceiling and floor can lead to a convoluted (messed up) journey.

"Path crossing" is one of the biggest pitfalls that both new and advanced people using memorization techniques to memorize foreign language vocabulary often fall into.


Learning and memorizing more than one language at the same time:
=================================================================
- It is definately possible.
- It follows all the principle that previously discussed namely: 
	- You have one palace for each letter of the alphabet.
	- You construct your journey in the palace in such a way that you do not trap yourself and you do not cross your own path

- To accomodate more than one languages, your journey needs to be split into separate channels/lanes (like lanes in a highway)

Example: If you are learning 3 languages: german, french and dutch.
So for alphabet "A", you have a memory palace "Accenture office braga".

Now you will definately have stations inside that memory palace. 

If you were learning one language then each station would represent one word but in case of 3 languages then each station will represent 3 words, obviously one at a time (Since you are reusing memory palace, so the same station represent different words in different language context in different journey of the same memory palace).
May be using different stations, you might have to use differnt story for each language journey as some similar words in one language like "Assasin" starts with letter "V" in french.


One language  = Single channel/lane journey based on target language.

Three languages  = Three channel/lane journey based on your mother language.


My understanding is that when using same MP for learning 3 languages, use english language word for each stations then change it to german, french and spanish in different lanes and connect them through some actions and keep the lanes separated by imagining that each lanes is made of different colors like red, green, blue and there is a lane divider between them.

- german path can be red colors path.
- french path can be green colors path.
- spanish path can be blue colors path.

Example:
Abracadabra (English alphabet "A" word representing one of the stations/words of "Accenture office" memory palace)

- Next in 3 corresponding lanes, we have german word, french word and spanish word for english "Abracadabra" and use different words for representing different images for those words.

Chances of mixing up multiple languages are there. But the way to fix it is you keep each images in different lanes so that spillover chances reduces.

- Amnother tip to avoid confusion is to to add something at the end of different wordss or images like
- Attach "beer" images for german word images, "brandy" images for french word images and "sangria" images for spainish words.

* beer, brandy and sangria are popular in each country. So if you are learning all three together then these images helps them separate.



Dealing with unfamiliar alphabets:
----------------------------------
- If the target language does not share the english language alphabets then the first thing to do is: learn the alphabets of that language and then rest of the process above is ame.

- Unfamiliar alphabets languages are: russian, chinese, japanese, hebrew etc.

Example: for learning "russian" alphabets, these are used to memorise/recall the sound of the alphabets:
A - MP station(outside front door) - Doctor forcing stick in my mouth say "ah"
Б - MP station(Inside front door) - Michael "Bay" is forced into a box by his fans.

Non english alphabets in russian:
Э - MP station(Bunsen burner stations in biology lab) - Students burning Euros ^ teacher yelling "hey-yeah" (eya sound).


- Make a memory palace(MP) with stations equal to the number of letters in alphabets of foreign language.
- 45 mins to hour and a half iss what is needed to sit down and memorise and recall forward and backward.


Practice pronounciation from different languages:
- Forvo.com
- Can hear pronounciation of words in any languages.
- Download these sounds and make a playlist in your mp3 player or phone and listen it to practice it.


How to memorize the spellings of vocabulary of any language:
============================================================

- Specifically applied to languages sharing english alphabets(european languages mostly).
- Associate each letter of an alphabet with  an image like:

A - Apple 
B - Boat 
C - Cat  and so on...

If the foreign language word that you need to memorise is "B-A-C".

Then create a visual image of a : "boat" throwing an "apple" on a "cat".
And this will help in memorising the letter of the word.



Practicals:

Memorise a list of words:
------------------------

The way you memorise a list is not by connecting different words by a story or by creating a memory palace.
Since sequence (1,2,3,4,5...19,20) exists in the list of words so you remember it by making a "relation between sequence number and corresponding words".

- Also you can connect the sequence and words to make a funny story for fast memory.



1. Unicorn = One single horn unicorn.
2. Electrical outlet (2 outlets with 2 holes in each and they are held on wall by 2 nuts.)
3. Tricycles (3 wheeled cycle)
4. Truck (4 wheeled)
5. Hand (5 fingers in hand, high-five)
6. Beer (6 pack, 6 gallons of beer)
7. Hockey stick (7 original hockey team, hockey player with number 7 jersey)
8. Spiders (8 legs spider with 8 inches long)
9. Baseball ()



Methods:
1. Associating sequence with words and make individual phrase independent from other words phrase. It has big margin of error, may not be very efficient.

2. Associate and connect next phrases of next words and make funny stories out of it. This is faster than first approach.

There are still faster methods that we will discuss next.

Our Memory is like a mental file folder system in a computer. If there is a cabinete of 10,000 files in alphabetical order then it will be very "easy and quick" to find file of Mr. Jones, jimmermans and andres file bcoz it is very organised.

Why it is fast ?
- Because it is organised and "you know where to look for".
- Our brain likes to work that way but we are not taught that way.

Elements of mental file/folder system:
- FIG(FIle, image, glue)

- We will glue "images" to "FILES". Glue works by invoking "Actions & emotions".

Sometimes we can remember some stuff and other times we can not remember it. That is why more often we can remember faces than names.

For long term memory:
---------------------

- Review in 1 hr, 1 day and then 1 week to commit to long term memory.



How to memorise speeches for public speaking:
--------------------------------------------

- Choose the topic.
- Create a list of 5-7 key points for your speech/presentation.
- Turn all those key points into images (5-7 images).
- Glue those images into stations of your memory palace or files of your cabinete.
- Thats it, now you can recall it.


How to memorise numbers:
-----------------------
- It can be used to remember "phone number", "pin numbers", "passwords", "license plate number", "mileage",
  "price for your product", anything related with numbers.

Technique:
- Assign each consonant to a number:

0 = s, z
1 = t, d
2 = n
3 = m
4 = r
5 = l
6 = j, sh, ch, soft g
7 = k, hard c, hard g
8 = f, v
9 = p, b

- Between 2 characters/letters, use vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and the consonants w, h, and y are not assigned to any digit and can be used freely to create words.

- For remembering 2 digit numbers like: 73 , corresponding 2 digit from above formula is "km".
Now make a word out of it to remember it : kilometer.

- For remembering a 9 digit phone number, divide it into 3 chunks like: 923-423-087
Then make a word out of each 3 digits and then join it with some actions in a story like:

923(pnm)/poonam
423(rnm)/rename
087(sfk)  / safe key

Poonam is rename as safe key === Thats a phone number.


- Initially it will take around 5 minutes to remember but eventually it will be quick.

Here is another way to remember numbers or phone numbers:
---------------------------------------------------------

- We will associate the things that we know with things we do not know.
Like, Number one and unicorn is associated with one horn on unicorn. So picture unicorn with one horn.
Electrical outlet has two prongs in electrical outlet which have 2 wires going through it (live and neutral).
Tricycle has Three wheels.
Truck has 4 wheels and 4 wheel drive so 4 * 4.
Golf Green course/ground ideally has Eighteen holes.
In harry porter, at age 17, you becomes wizard with spells.
Picture sweet sixteen Candles on a birthday cake.


Remember below lists:
1. Unicorn = one horn unicorn 
2. Electrical outlet = two prongs in electrical outlet
3. Tricycle = Three wheels
4. Truck = 4 * 4
5. Hand = five fingers
6. Beer = six pack
7. Hockey stick = Shaped like a seven
8. Spider = Eight legs
9. Baseball = nine innings
10. Dime = ten cents
11. Chopsticks = Looks like an eleven
12. Roses = twelve thorns
13. Black cat = Friday the thirteenth
14. Gold = Fourteen carat gold
15. Dollar sign ($) = Tax day - april 15th
16. Candles = sweet sixteen
17. Wizard = Seventeen spells
18. Golf Green = Eighteen holes
19. Sauna  = Nineteen degrees
20. Dartboard = Twenty times hit bullseyes in dartboard

Remembering number:
847 = A spider driving a truck with a hockey stick in the back
723 = Hockey stick plugged into electrical outlet sitting on a tricycle.
1920 = Sitting inside sauna, hitting bullseyes into dartboard.

- It is much faster than above as here we do not need to atleast create a word out of consonant as it is already created . We just need to make a story out of those words.


Your brain thinks in images so need to convert either numbers, texts, phrase, speech or vocabulary into images for our brain to consume it easily.


Learning foreign language:
===========================
1. Learn a spanish word "zapatos" meaning shoes:

- Turn word "zapatos" into an image. 
  What could be an image for "zapatos" ? 
  or What comes to mind when you think "zapatos" ?
- "Zapping toes" or "Lightning bolt zapping toes" are things comes to mind.

- So, now if the definition means "shoes", what's zapping your toes ? - A pair of shoes  and thats it and thats the trigger.
- It does not make any sense: shoes can't zap your toes ?. (I mean with shoes you can zap but shoes will not do it automatically, we need some action/reason for shoes to do it)
  But a lightning bolt can do so. So the image will be:
  "Once you wear shoes, then ligntning bolt will come out of it zzzzz and zap yur shoes".
  So you now have connected it.

- Once you see the word "Zapatos" and if you have created an image like above, you need to review it in 1 hour, 1 day and 1 week to commit it into long term memory and the recall will be very very smooth.


2. Learn  spanish word "cerveza" meaning beer:

- Imagine the image for "cerveza".
- It sounds like "serve vase". Observing the sound of a foreign word helps in forming an image for that word. 
Unlike "zapatos" which was easy to come up with image like "zapping toes" just by observing the word, for "Cerveza", we need to observe the sound of the word: "Serve vase".

- So the image is "Serve a vase full of beer".

In learning a language, the most difficult and time consuming part is:
- Learning a word
- Learning the translation and meaning.

One guy went to cairo, Egypt and without having any knowledge of Arabic, just by employing the above trick, he learned arabic. 
Three weeks in cairo and people on the streets were already asking them, how many years they have lived in Egypt ?
- They were taking a class and they were committing 50 words a day in memory using above method.
- They were mentally exhausted but they were already speaking the language as if they were there for years.
- 50 words a day, translated it, turn it into pictures. They became realy good at it as more days passed by and it became easier and easier and easier.


3. Learn word "Pamplemousse" meaning grapes.

- The above word can be broken to : pimple moose.
- So the image could be "pimple moose eating a grape fruit" or the more gross image could be:
  "All the pimples are grapefruit in moose." The more strong the emotion or gross, the easier the recall.

 Note:
 - The more obscene, the more weird or more gross or more strong feeling, the easier the recall.


How to remember, where we kept: keys, glass, purse.
-----------------------------------------------------
- When you enter the home, then you drop your "key" in hall table. Think of your "Key" as a bomb that you threw. So after sometime if you need to remember where you kept your "key" ?
You simply need to remember what exploded and then you can recall it easily.

- Thinkk of "Glass" as "waterfall" or "lightning storm". Think of these in terms of natural calamities to picture them, simply because it is easy to picture them.

- Think of "purse" as "tornado". So when you need to remember it, just ask the question what got swirled up in tornado ? And this will help in immediate recall.


Memory palace tip to create best memory palace:
-----------------------------------------------
- In the room, your stations should be different. Like if you have 2 similar Tvs, if there is no difference even in color or size and both are same then you need to eliminate one of them in selecting stations meaning instead of 2 stations for 2 Tvs, we will have one stations.

In our room we have 3 similar chairs, no difference in size/color but we have different orientations of atleast 2 chairs across a table then we can have 2 stations for those two chairs. Make sure it is something specific.

- The best way of moving in MP is "Clockwise" as clock moves in that direction so make it a standard that all the MP you move clockwise only.

- Choose the stations which can have some actions like grinder, oven etc but not pictures on wall as there can be no action on it.
- Mentally go forward and backward in both directions.


Real world applications for memory methods:
-------------------------------------------

- If you need to discuss few things with your clients, on an avg. is 5-6 points.
- Whatever points that you might have or want to discuss can be stored in body file system.
- And whatever answers or things, clients need to discuss can be stored in house file system.

So you become a better listener to your friends/family or to clients.



Word list to practice:
======================

EP 49

1. Microphone
2. Toilet
3. Magic markers
4. Hose
5. Curious George
6. Bobby pins
7. Robot
8. Bobcat
9. G.I Joe

14. Christmas tree
15. Barbie Doll
16. Zoo
17. Jewels
18. Lizard
19. Bathtub

- Use memory palace to remember them or "house file system".



4 stages of learning:
=======================

1. Unconscious incompetence 
  - You simply do not know about something like bowling, never heard about it.

2. Conscious incompetence 
  - You know about something but you do not know how to do it.
  Like surgery, you heard about it but you do not know how to do it ?
  You need to go to medical school to learn to do it.

3. Conscious competence 
  - You know how to do it, you need to think about it but you can do it.

4. UnConscious competence 
  - You know how to do it effortlessly like on an autopilot. 
  This is the ultimate goal. When you start learning motor cycle, it is first you do not know how to ride it but with enough practice you go on an auto pilot.

  In terms of memory learning, you are at "Conscious competence".


 For learning Portuguese language:
 =================================

 - Make a memory palace for each alphabet
 - Inside each alphabets memory palace, remember atleast 50 verbs. E.g inside "A - Accenture office" memory palace, store 50 verbs. SImilarly go to each memory palace and store 50 verbs starting from that alphabet.
 - Total 1300 words = advanced level mastery.

** For learning words or names or formula, we need to change it into an image as our brain only remembers images.


Body File system:
=================
- It is used for very active activity purpose like :
	- speech or 
	- discussion with clients or 
	- remembering grocery lists or 
	- things you need to do during the day or next day.

All of the above purposes needs very active recall.

If you are going to talk with new people or meeting friends, you need to remember 5-6 new and funny topics that you want to talk about. For that purposes, you do not need a memory palace but body file system.

- Your different body parts will become individual files/stations of your file system and you need to apply FIG (File, image, glue).

- It will have 10 specific files/stations/body parts.

10 body-parts:
--------------
1. Soles of your feet.
2. Shins or tibia bone.
3. Legs
4. Butt
5. Tummy
6. Ribs
7. Collarbone
8. Mouth
9. Nose
10. Forehead
