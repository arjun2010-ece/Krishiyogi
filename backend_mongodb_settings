USAGE OF MONGO DB DATABASE:
-------------------------------

a. https://cloud.mongodb.com/
b. Click on "create" to create new clusters and select "shared" for free usage.

DELETE inactive clusters and associated project
-----------------------------------------------
For inacttive clusters, which can not be resumed, we need to first delete the cluster then the associated project in it.

on default project you see something like this:

ARJUN'S ORG - 2019-07-26 > EVENT_BOOKING_APP

and in the UI , you see ...(3 dots), click on that and select "Terminate".
This will terminate clusters (which is a group of servers having database and data).


Next click on "ARJUN'S ORG - 2019-07-26" in above UI which will display lists of projects in that deleted cluster and then you can click on delete icon.


And then click on any projects from above lists to go to its cluster again and then repeat the process.

Just remember the hirarchy is:
 Organisation ---> Project ----> Cluster ----> DB -----> Tables.

 This "ARJUN'S ORG - 2019-07-26" is organisation.
 a. First create organisation.
 b. Create project.
 c. Create deployment cluster
 d. Create database

Once cluster is create then click on "Connect", where DB credentials will be autogenerated and then save it. It is used to generate connection url or string.

arjun
arjun123

Next "Connection method" will be visible, where you need to select "Connect with application".
It will decide in which backend language you will use DB and thus connection string or url.

Connection string or url::
mongodb+srv://arjun:<password>@projavascriptcluster.mt1zoa0.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=proJavascriptCluster


npm install mongodb

Learnings>>>>
1. DB cluster can be controlled to communicate to only specific IP addresses as happened in ashoks application long time.

2. We need to add "0.0.0.0/0" as all the IP addresses can connect to this DB clusters.

3. In mongodb, you can edit or access I_P settings through sidebar "Network access".
